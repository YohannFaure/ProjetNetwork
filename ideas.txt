Betweeness = fouille merde, i.e. communities that look at many others

pairwise disconnectivity

Closeness : high discovery, if entering edges -> high closeness = high growth rate

Eigenvector centrality : most used communities ~ similar to pagerank

Katz centrality : ?

community detection ?
    example : if undirected positive graph, detect the circlejerk (= communities that love eachother), if undirected negative, detect the shitstorm groups.

Node similarity ? Assortativity/homophily    VS    Disassortativity

degree assortativity

Modularity
